## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **AI Generation:**
   - Requires Google API key (optional feature)
   - 3-5 second wait time
   - Accuracy varies by image quality
   - **Workaround:** Manual entry always available

2. **Email Contact:**
   - Opens default email client
   - No in-app messaging yet
   - **Future:** Add built-in chat system

3. **Image Storage:**
   - 3 images max per listing
   - **Future:** Allow more images or video

4. **Occasional Loading Spinner:**
   - Rarely, the app may appear stuck on a loading screen.
   - Refreshing the page resolves it (state rehydrates and background fetch completes).
   - Likely causes: transient network hiccups during initial Supabase session fetch or a race during client boot.
   - Current mitigations: background refresh on tab focus; auth safety timeout (5s) to avoid indefinite loading; non-blocking toasts on fetch errors.

### Planned Enhancements

**Phase 2 Features:**
- [ ] In-app messaging system
- [ ] User ratings and reviews
- [ ] Push notifications for new matches
- [ ] Verification badges
- [ ] Payment integration (optional)
- [ ] NYU SSO authentication

**Scalability:**
- [ ] Multi-campus support (NYU Shanghai, NYC)
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] Analytics for users
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)

## 📈 Scalability Assessment

### Current Architecture

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Serverless (Next.js + Supabase)
