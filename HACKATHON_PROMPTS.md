- Reloading data when tab becomes visible
- Don't show loading spinner, refresh in background
- Prevent memory leaks with mounted tracker
```

**Result:** Tab focus handlers added to all data-loading pages

---

#### Prompt 11: Code Review
```
Go through the whole project again and check for anything that needs to be fixed:

- Make it mobile-friendly
```

**Result:** New color palette (purple/aqua/yellow), hero sections, improved animations

---

#### Prompt 13: Statistics Dashboard
```
Add a statistics page showing:
- Total number of listings
- Total users
- Platform activity metrics
