## üí° TALKING POINTS FOR JUDGES

### When They Ask: "What makes this special?"

**Answer:**
> "GiveNTake isn't just a marketplace - it's a complete ecosystem for student commerce. What makes it unique is the **wishlist feature** - a reverse marketplace where students post what they need, and others contact them if they have it. Combined with **AI-powered listing generation** using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, it removes all friction from buying and selling on campus."

### When They Ask: "How did you use AI?"

**Answer:**
> "I used AI at two levels: First, **GitHub Copilot** for development - I documented 40+ strategic prompts using role-playing, chain-of-thought, and iterative refinement. You can see my complete prompt engineering journey in HACKATHON_PROMPTS.md. Second, I integrated **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** into the product itself for image analysis and auto-generating listing details. This demonstrates both AI-assisted development AND AI as a product feature."

### When They Ask: "What's the impact?"

**Answer:**
> "GiveNTake solves real NYUAD student problems: textbooks are expensive, finding used dorm items is hard, and Facebook groups are disorganized and unsafe. By creating a closed, campus-only marketplace with safety guidelines, we reduce waste, save money, and build community. The wishlist feature is especially impactful - instead of hoping someone posts what you need, you can ask for it directly. It's scalable to other NYU campuses and can expand to event tickets, ride-sharing, and more."

### When They Ask: "Show me the AI prompts"

**Answer:**
> "I documented everything in HACKATHON_PROMPTS.md. Here's my approach: [Open file] I started with role-playing to establish context, used chain-of-thought for systematic feature development, and iterative refinement to polish the UI. For example, I didn't just ask for 'a marketplace' - I said 'Create a vibrant, student-friendly marketplace with purple-aqua-yellow colors, hero sections, and smooth animations.' The specificity got better results."
