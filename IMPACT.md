# üåç Impact Statement - GiveNTake

## Problem
NYUAD students currently rely on ad-hoc platforms (e.g., Facebook groups) for buying and selling items. These platforms are:
- Disorganized and difficult to search
- Lacking safety guidelines and accountability
- Not optimized for student use cases (textbooks, dorm essentials)
- Missing a way to ask for items you want (reverse marketplace)

## Solution
GiveNTake is a secure, student-friendly marketplace that enables:
- Buying/selling with profiles and safety guidelines
- Organized browsing by category and condition
- AI-assisted listing creation to reduce friction
- A Wishlist feature so students can post what they need and be contacted by peers

## Why It Matters
- Sustainability: Encourages reuse and reduces waste on campus
- Financial Relief: Helps students save on textbooks and essentials
- Community: Builds trusted exchanges within the university
- Safety: Provides guidelines and contact transparency

## Evidence of Impact
- Complete feature set and a live deployment (https://giventake3.me)
- Reverse marketplace differentiator (Wishlist)
- Student-focused categories and flows

## Scalability
- Multi-campus ready: Supabase/Postgres scales, Next.js supports high traffic
- Easy to fork and brand for other universities
- Potential additions: Campus ID verification, transaction ratings, delivery lockers

## Future Directions
- Reputation system (ratings and reviews)
- Real-time chat with safety tooling (masking emails/phones until trust established)
- Smart pricing suggestions based on historical data
- Integration with campus services (lost & found, sustainability office)
